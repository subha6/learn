    <h1> My Data Science Journey </h1>
    <p> Math and Science are so cool. When I graduated from college with a Math degree, I used to wonder what path and career I can take to utilize my skills and make a decent living. I have been working im different fields every since. 
      Then a few years back, I discovered the most beautiful Data Science field which brings together Math and Computer Science.

     <br/> I would love to create a website with my own blog, writing about my journey so it coul help and guide others who might be aspiring to enter a brand new field just like me. </p>
